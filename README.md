# Classic_Python_Hangman_Game
This repository contains Python codes for the classic Hang Man game. The user will be assigned a random word to guess, one character at a time. If the user gets everything right, the program says "Well Done!", but if the user can't get the word right in 6 tries, the program says "Game Over!" 

Credit: The codes in this repository were inspired by Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course on Udemy. You can go to the course's page by clicking the following link (not a ref. link): https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/
