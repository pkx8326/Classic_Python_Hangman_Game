# Classic_Python_Hangman_Game
This repository contains Python codes for the classic Hang Man game. The user will be assigned a random word to guess, one character at a time. If the user gets everything right, the program says "Well Done!", but if the user can't get the word right in 6 tries, the program says "Game Over!"
